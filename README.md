## Red-Black Tree (Árvore Rubro-Negra)
Final Project for my Data Structures class at the Federal University of Pará, Brazil.
The assignment was to apply one of the studied structures in some small project or to implement a more complex structure.
I chose to implement, in Python, the structure known as Red-Black Tree.
